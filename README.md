# Google Fiber Box Setup

Here I will document and attempt to provide basic instructions, with bare bones explination as I see fit on how to bypass your Google Fiber Network Box to place your own Firewall directly on the Google Fiber Fiber Jack without routing through the Fiber Box. My adventure will cover Cisco Catalyst switches, as that's what I have in my lab.

_The source of most of this configuraiton comes out from a colleages. Much thanks to him for all his help!_
